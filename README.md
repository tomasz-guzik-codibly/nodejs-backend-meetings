### Pros of using Express.js over native HTTP Node.js module
#### Express
1. **Simplicity**: Express.js provides a simple and intuitive API for building web applications. It abstracts away many low-level details of handling HTTP requests and responses, making it easier and more efficient to write server-side code.


2. **Routing**: Express.js has a powerful routing system that allows you to define routes and handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for specific URL patterns. This makes it convenient to organize and structure your application's endpoints.


3. **Middleware**: Express.js supports middleware, which are functions that can be executed before or after the main request handler. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and data parsing. This modular approach simplifies the code and promotes reusability.


4. **Error Handling**: Express.js provides built-in error handling mechanisms, making it easier to handle and respond to errors that occur during the request-response cycle. You can define custom error handling middleware to centralize error handling logic and improve code maintainability.


5. **Middleware Ordering**: Express.js allows you to control the order in which middleware functions are executed, giving you fine-grained control over the request/response flow. This flexibility is useful when you have specific requirements for the order of operations.

### Middlewares
In Node.js, middlewares are a core concept used in frameworks like Express.js to handle the request-response cycle. Middlewares are functions that have access to the request and response objects, as well as the next function in the application's request-response cycle. They can perform various tasks such as modifying the request or response objects, processing data, or executing additional logic.

Here's an overview of how middlewares work in Node.js:

1. Middleware Functions: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the `req`, `res`, and `next` objects. They can perform actions on the request and response objects, and also invoke the `next` function to pass control to the next middleware in the chain.

2. Middleware Chain: Middlewares can be chained together to form a sequence of actions that are executed in the order they are defined. Each middleware function can perform its specific task and then pass control to the next middleware by calling the `next` function.

3. Request-Response Flow: When a request is received, it passes through the middleware chain sequentially. Each middleware has the opportunity to modify the request or response objects or perform additional logic. The response is then sent back to the client once the middleware chain is complete.

4. Error Handling: Middlewares can also handle errors by defining error-handling middleware functions. Error-handling middlewares have an additional `err` parameter and are typically defined as the last middleware in the chain. They can catch errors and send appropriate responses or perform necessary actions.

Middlewares provide a flexible way to handle various tasks in a Node.js application, such as authentication, logging, request validation, error handling, and more. They allow for modular and reusable code, making it easier to maintain and extend the application's functionality.

### Routing
Routing is a fundamental concept in web applications, including those built with Node.js. It allows developers to define the logic for handling different HTTP requests and mapping them to specific functions or handlers. Routing plays a crucial role in directing incoming requests to the appropriate endpoints or resources within a Node.js application.

Here's an overview of how routing works in Node.js:

1. Route Definition: Routes in Node.js applications define the mapping between URLs (or URL patterns) and the corresponding code that should be executed when a request matching that URL is received. Developers define routes using a routing framework or library such as Express.js.

2. HTTP Methods: Routes are typically associated with specific HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. Each HTTP method represents a specific type of request, and routes are defined to handle requests of a particular method. For example, a route may be defined to handle GET requests for retrieving data.

3. URL Patterns: Routes can also include URL patterns or parameters to make the routes more dynamic and flexible. URL patterns can be used to capture dynamic values from the URL, such as an ID or a username. These captured values can then be used within the route's handler function.

4. Route Resolution: When an incoming request is received, the Node.js application matches the request's URL and HTTP method against the defined routes. If a matching route is found, the associated middleware and handler functions are executed in the defined order. If no matching route is found, a default or error route can be used to handle the request.

5. Response Handling: Routes and their corresponding handlers are responsible for generating the appropriate response based on the request. This can involve querying a database, performing calculations, rendering views, or returning JSON data. The response is then sent back to the client.

Routing allows developers to create a logical structure for handling incoming requests in a Node.js application. It provides a way to organize and manage different endpoints, enabling developers to build complex web applications with multiple routes and resources.

Popular Node.js frameworks like Express.js provide a robust routing mechanism that simplifies the process of defining routes and handling HTTP requests. By leveraging routing capabilities, developers can create clean and maintainable code for handling different routes and providing the desired functionality in their Node.js applications.


### Logging
Logging is an essential aspect of Node.js applications, providing a way to capture and record relevant information about the application's execution. Logging allows developers to track and monitor the behavior of the application, debug issues, and gain insights into its performance.

Here's an overview of how logging works in Node.js:

1. Logging Libraries: Node.js offers several logging libraries, such as `winston`, `log4js`, and `pino`, that provide convenient methods for logging messages at different levels of severity, such as `info`, `debug`, `warn`, and `error`. These libraries also offer various features like log formatting, log rotation, and log transport options.

2. Logging Configuration: Logging libraries can be configured to determine the log output destination, format, and level of verbosity. Developers can specify whether logs should be written to the console, files, databases, or other destinations. Configuration options also allow for customization of log timestamps, log levels, and log message formats.

3. Logging Levels: Logging libraries often support different logging levels to categorize the severity of log messages. These levels help developers differentiate between informational logs, warnings, errors, and debug logs. By setting the appropriate logging level, developers can control the amount of information logged, ensuring that only relevant information is captured.

4. Log Output: Log messages can be written to different output destinations, depending on the configuration. Common destinations include the console, log files, external services like log management platforms or aggregators, or databases. The log output can be formatted in a human-readable or machine-readable format based on the specific requirements.

5. Logging Best Practices: When implementing logging in a Node.js application, it's important to follow best practices. This includes avoiding excessive logging, ensuring log messages are meaningful and informative, considering log rotation to manage log file size, and properly handling sensitive information in log messages.

Logging plays a crucial role in application development, providing valuable insights and helping developers diagnose issues. Properly implemented logging can significantly aid in troubleshooting, monitoring, and maintaining Node.js applications, ultimately leading to improved performance and user experience.



### Streams
Node.js streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js that enable efficient handling of data flow. Streams provide an abstraction to work with data in chunks or chunks of data over time, rather than processing the entire data set at once. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data or when working with data that arrives or needs to be processed incrementally.

In Node.js, streams are implemented using the `Stream` module, which provides a base API for working with different types of streams, such as readable, writable, and transform streams. Here's an overview of how each type of stream works:

- Readable Streams: Readable streams represent a source of data that can be read in a sequential manner. They emit `data` events whenever new data is available and an `end` event when all data has been consumed.

- Writable Streams: Writable streams represent a destination for data to be written to. They provide a way to write data to various destinations, such as files, network sockets, or databases.

- Transform Streams: Transform streams are a special type of duplex stream, meaning they can both read and write data. They provide a way to modify or transform data as it passes through the stream. Transform streams can be used for tasks like data compression, encryption, or parsing.

Streams can be piped together to create data flow pipelines, where the output of one stream is connected to the input of another stream. This allows for a modular and efficient way of processing data. By piping streams together, Node.js can optimize memory usage and handle data in smaller chunks, reducing the overall memory footprint.

By leveraging streams, Node.js enables efficient processing of data, especially when dealing with large data sets or real-time data. Streams allow for incremental and asynchronous processing, making them well-suited for tasks like file I/O, network communication, data transformation, and more.
